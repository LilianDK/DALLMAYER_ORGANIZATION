### Data
- We are receiving the raw data right after their OCR pre-processing on which we shall work
- They recommend not to use the API because data is changing there. Instead they ask us to download the data from the given link
- If we do not have enough disk space we can work with a fraction of the provided data instead of the total dataset
- We must not enrich the data with other data sources because of licensing etc.

### IP
- The IP remains on our side. They offer to support in publishing on their hermes blog
- The scans of the original sources are also available and the licensing is individual per outlet etc. It is assumed that we could retrieve licinsing information from the API

### Expected deliverables
- We have to deliver 2 things: (1) Forschungsfrage/Fragestellung und (2) Ansatz A oder Ansatz B
